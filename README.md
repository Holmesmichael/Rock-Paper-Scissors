# Rock-Paper-Scissors
RPS Ruby game Classic Game

The computer starts out by asking to type "r", "p", "s" (for "rock", "paper", or "scissors", respectively), "x" (which shows the score) or "q" (for "quit") at the command line.

If you enter "i", you will enter an "Impossible mode" in which you are not able to win... sorry.

If you enter an "r", "p", or "s", it will reveal whether it chose rock, paper, or scissors, and who won. A point then gets added to the appropriate players' score (both start at 0).

If a "q" is entered the computer should show the score and quit the Ruby process, returning control to the command line.

If an "x" is entered, the computer should show the score and prompt the user again for input.

If the user enters an invalid input, the computer should show an error message and ask the user to enter again.
